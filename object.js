    // now  we can check the value of objects like
console.log(obj.d.r.s.)
    //we can also add some in properties of objects like his
obj.l = 1111;
// here a ,b,c are the properties of objects
// nesting of objects  can also be done
//then they can be cces by the method
//to delete properties we can  do
// delete obj.b

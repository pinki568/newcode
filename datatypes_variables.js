// here we can see that  all varibale are declared with let
// and varibale num is assigned two values
//so what is the concept of variable and datatype
// variable is a container and data is puted inside it
// data always have a type  integer(1),"abc " (string)
// but some language say  variable also have type
// variable tells us about the data it can contain
//in other languages  like c++
// if i=10; is declared then it is not possible  to assign 
// i="abc" it is not possible in  c++
// but javascript says that variables does not have any type
//means here variable does not tells what type of data it can hold
//it can take any type of data
// there is a oprator in javascript typeof which tells about the type of data
console.log(typeof true)
    // so typeof operator  does not tell type of variale
    //it tells about the type of data  a variable contain

// in other languages we write function inc(int x,char y) bu in javascript there is no 
//int or char so we write var x,var y. and there is no logic to write 
// var again and again so what we can do is
// we dont know what type of value it contain
function incr(x) {
    return (x + 1)
} // we can also define function in  console 
incr(4)
